Queries the Last.FM api to create a playlist of similar tracks based on a seeding track.

**Installation**

You can grab the addon from Mortstar's repository.
http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Unofficial_Add-on_Repositories

I strongly suggest that you install the Repositories Installer Addon
http://passion-xbmc.org/addons/?Page=View&ID=plugin.program.repo.installer which allows you to browse and install repositories from the Unofficial Add-on Repositories wiki page.


Or if you prefer you can grab the .zip from github

https://github.com/mortstar/repository-mortstar-addons/tree/master/repo/script.lastfmplaylistgeneratorPM

However, downloading the repo as outlined above is much more desirable as you will keep the addon up-to-date as well as automatically downloading the correct dependencies.

Once you have mortstar's repo installed, you'll find the Last.FM playlist generator (Partymode) addon in the Program addons section. Install the addon from here

While the track is playing, start the script

Wait while the script creates a playlist for you.

**Usage (PartyMode version):**

Start the script (it runs in the background until you close xbmc)
